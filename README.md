Description: Iâ€™m building a simulation of an electric vehicle charging station using LEDs and buttons. The project involves managing button inputs (with debouncing) and coordinating how the LEDs behave to mimic the real-life charging process. When the charging starts, the LEDs light up progressively, and different actions, like starting, stopping, or resetting, trigger specific sequences for the LEDs and buttons to follow, just like a real charging station.

Components: 
~ Breadboard
~ 6x 100-ohm Resistors
~ 4x Blue LEDs
~ 1x RGB LED
~ 2x Buttons
~ 2x 10K Resistors
~ Jumper Wires
